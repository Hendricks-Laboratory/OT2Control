        This method should take care of all training. It is expected that it will update
        the model in whatever way is fitting for your model. It will be called when the user
        calls train.  
        Use extreme caution when implementing this method, and note that self is NOT threadsafe.
        i.e. if you plan on using any of the attributes of this class, make sure you lock them
        appropriately, or only use them in this method (WITH A HUGE COMMENT SOMEWHERE)  
        The line of code in this method should almost always be, with self.model_lock: ...  
        Strictly speaking, the model_lock is overkill. Since we always join this method before
        calling predict which uses the model, but it's good practice if other methods ever use
        the model_lock.  
        As long as we freeze the ml_model while training, things are simple, and this allows
        the controller to run other commands while we're training, but I've implemented the
        architecture to have the ml_model do other work while it's training.
